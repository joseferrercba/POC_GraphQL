# What is GraphQL?

> GraphQL is a data query language and specification developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly open sourced in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST-based architectures with the purpose of increasing developer productivity and minimizing amounts of data transferred. GraphQL is used in production by hundreds of organizations of all sizes including Facebook, Credit Karma, GitHub, Intuit, PayPal, the New York Times and many more.
